# Settings and project overrides

On web and desktop, the "Applying settings for …" sentence at the top of Settings pages picks
the project and environment a change applies to. Pages that only hold device preferences, such as
Appearance, don't show it. They start at **All projects** and **All environments**
and stay selected as you move between categories or search for a setting.

Preferences saved on this device, such as appearance, confirmations and browser profiles, always
show and ignore the selection. Everything else is stored on a server. Choose one environment to
edit its settings, or leave **All environments** to edit every connected environment at once.
Offline environments keep their current values; this is a bulk edit, not a synced global default.

Choose a project to override settings for it on the selected environments. A layers icon beside
each server row's title shows where the value comes from: the built-in default, the environment,
or a project override. Click it to see that chain on every selected environment. An override can
be reset to inherit again. Settings that cannot be overridden by a project are shown read-only
while a project is selected.

When the selected environments disagree, the control shows **Mixed** in place of a value and the
layers icon turns amber. Picking a value applies it to every selected environment.

Changing an environment value never touches a project's own override. When projects override the
setting you are editing, the layers icon counts them and the chain lists each one with its value:
click a project to jump to it, or **Reset all** to make those projects follow the environment
again.

Providers and diagnostics are per machine: they show one environment at a time, the primary
one until you pick another. Every other setting fans out to the selection.

With a project selected, a provider's switch in **Settings → Providers** turns it on or off for
that project only, in either direction: a provider off on the machine can be used in one project,
and one on everywhere can be kept out of another. That project's model pickers follow the switch,
and no new turn there can start on a provider it turned off, including queued messages and
follow-ups from delegated tasks. A turn already running when the switch flips finishes. A delegated
task's result still lands in its parent thread, which sees it on its next turn. Reset returns the project to the
machine's setting. Every other provider setting stays per machine.

On mobile, open **Settings** and use the filter in its header to choose connected environments
and a project. The filter stays available in server-setting pages. With **All projects** selected,
the server-setting pages, such as Threads, Source control and Worktrees, edit the selected
environments' defaults. Choosing a project edits its overrides on the selected
environments. Use **Use defaults** in a page to remove that page's project overrides.
Open **Settings → Projects** to rename the project across its selected
connected checkouts and see where those checkouts live.
Settings that are environment-wide stay read-only while a project is selected. When selected
targets disagree, a control shows **Mixed** until you choose one value. Appearance, keyboard,
and other phone-only settings ignore the filter.

## Pin and archive projects

Pinned projects come first in the project pickers: the project picker on a new thread, the
new-thread list, the command palette, the sidebar project filter, and mobile. In the boring sidebar, pinned projects get the top
folders, even with no active threads. Pin or unpin a project from its row in any of those lists,
or press the thread pin shortcut (`mod+shift+p` by default) on the highlighted row. **Pin
project** in the command palette and **Settings → Projects** work too. A list keeps its order
while it is open, so a new pin moves up the next time you open it.

Archive a project you are done with in **Settings → Projects**. It leaves the project pickers.
Its threads, settings, and files stay as they are, and archived projects still show in the
Settings project list, marked **Archived**. Choose one there and select **Unarchive** to bring it
back. On mobile, both are in **Settings → Projects → Organize**.

A project on several machines must have every machine connected to pin or archive it.

## Worktree branch names

In **Settings → Worktrees → Worktree branch naming**, choose a static prefix,
a model-selected semantic prefix such as `feat/` or `fix/`, or custom instructions
for the complete name. The static prefix defaults to `t3/`; a trailing slash is
optional, and an empty prefix adds nothing. Invalid characters in a static prefix
are replaced with hyphens. Custom instructions are appended to
the naming prompt and can specify issue IDs, namespaces, and casing.

These settings apply to automatically named new worktree branches. Select a project
to override its environment defaults. Worktree directories keep their original names.
If generation fails, or a custom name is invalid or already taken, the temporary
branch name remains.

## Scheduled tasks

Open **Settings → Scheduled tasks** to create scheduled tasks or manage existing
ones across your connected environments. Use the settings filter to narrow the
list by environment or project. Each task runs on the environment you choose,
using its project, model, and workspace settings. Fixed-time schedules use that
environment's time zone, which may differ from your phone's. Choose **Once**
to run a task a single time at a date and time in your own time zone. If the
environment is offline then, the task runs when it is back.

Under **Destination**, choose where runs go. **New thread each run** keeps every
run separate. The two one-thread choices start a thread on the first run and post
later runs there: one continues the same conversation, the other starts each run
in a fresh session that doesn't see earlier runs, so the thread stays readable
without the agent's context growing. To move a one-thread task, pick another
thread in its project under **Destination**. Moving such a task to another
project starts a new thread there on its next run.

On web and desktop, open a main conversation’s **Automations** panel and
choose **Enable idle work check-in**. Manage it here in Scheduled tasks. Every
30 minutes it checks whether that thread is idle with at most one working
subagent. Busy checks are skipped. Check-ins also skip the model turn when the
thread’s work, queue, and watched conditions have not changed since the last run.
The task shows **skipped: no change**. Enable **Run even when unchanged** to
always run an idle check-in. The reminder is labeled as an automated cron
message and asks about ready, authorized work. Turn **Enabled** off here to stop
it; the agent can also pause it when work is done or waiting for you.

Ask the agent to resume this conversation when another thread or one of its
delegated tasks finishes, or when a commit or branch lands on a repository’s local
main branch. It can save a one-shot wake condition and end its turn. Thread and
task wakes fire as soon as that thread or task finishes; landing wakes are checked
at the saved interval. Each queues one message saying what fired. Git conditions track the commit selected when the wake was saved, so they
still work after the source branch is deleted. View and cancel wakes in the
thread’s Automations panel or **Settings → Scheduled tasks**. Pausing or deleting
the task cancels its pending wake.

Choose **Event** under Schedule to run a task when a turn ends, a thread is created or
settles, or a status source changes. Narrow it to this project or to listed
threads, optionally with their forks, subagents, and delegated threads. A status
source event can be narrowed to one source and the state it changes to. The run's
prompt ends with what happened. **Cooldown** sets the minimum time between runs for
the same thread or status source; events during it run once when it ends.
**Coalesce** waits after the first event and runs once with the latest. Event
tasks run at most 12 times an hour unless **Limits** sets another number; events
over it wait for the next hour. A task that runs when a turn ends waits 60 seconds
per thread by default. Threads a task starts, and its own turns, never trigger it.

**Limits** caps each run of the task's thread, including turns you start there:
its cost in dollars, its tokens, how many subagents it may start, and runs per
hour. Follow-ups the agent queues for itself belong to the same run. A run over
its cost or token budget stops mid-turn and shows as stopped at its budget; the
agent can't continue it until the next scheduled run. Cost counts the agent's
priced usage plus an estimate for its subagents and compaction, so a run can stop
a little early. With a subagent or budget limit, the agent's own subagent tools
are off and subagents go through T3 Code, on the task's model unless the agent
was given others. The agent can't start, fork or message threads outside the
task, answer or reorder their turns, or act in linked environments. Subagent limits work with Claude and Codex models. An agent in a
task with limits can't create tasks, change limits or run tasks now. A limited
task's runs use its model in threads it
started; a thread you started keeps the model you picked. Over the hourly limit,
scheduled runs and webhook requests are skipped and listed as over the cap;
**Run now** is never limited.

Deleting a thread also deletes tasks that post into that thread. Tasks that start
a new thread on each run survive deletion of their previous threads.

You can edit, pause, resume, run immediately, or delete a task from the list.
Webhook tasks only run when their URL is called, so they can't be run
immediately.
Leaving an edited form asks before discarding unsaved changes.

## Standards watchers

On web and desktop, open **Settings → Scheduled tasks → Watchers** to schedule
read-only reviews of a project's conversations. Choose the model, schedule,
thread targets and standards to check. A watcher uses the model you select and
reports a failure if it is unavailable.

Open **Alerts** on the right to read findings and their quoted evidence. A watcher
sees a bounded snapshot, so missing context can limit its conclusions. You can
dismiss or snooze a finding, reopen it, or pause its watcher.

Enable **Review after each completed turn** to check the thread that just finished,
with a per-thread cooldown of at least one minute (ten minutes by default). The
schedule continues independently. Choose **Alerts only** to keep all findings in
the Alerts bell. Add instruction file paths on the server's machine (`~/` uses
that server user's home), or include the project's root `AGENTS.md`. Missing files
limit the review, and instruction sources are truncated at 64 KiB.

With thread delivery, a watcher can offer advice to an active agent when its provider supports steering
without interrupting tools. The agent can agree or explain a disagreement. The
watcher checks fresh evidence and records a short report: corrected, accepted
explanation, unresolved or unverified. Agreement alone does not count as a
verified correction. The report stays available even if the thread is idle and
cannot receive the advisory.

## Context reviews

Open **Inspect → Context** from the sidebar's strip to see each turn's instruction sizes,
injected tools, file and knowledge reads, repeated reads and reported token usage.
Read counts from shell commands are inferred. Missing provider telemetry stays
unknown. Use **Older turns** to page through the history.

In **Settings → Scheduled tasks → Watchers**, choose **Context management** and
select Claude Haiku. New context watchers start paused. Enable one to opt in, or
run it once manually. Each run reviews recent context records with a 3,000-token
output limit and a $0.05 budget. Suggestions appear as proposed Workspace
decisions. Accept or reject them before asking an agent to change instructions,
skills or knowledge. The reviewer never edits those files itself.

## Webhook automations

In **Settings → Scheduled tasks**, choose **Webhook**
as a task's schedule to run it whenever another service calls its URL, such as
GitHub on a new pull request or a CI job that failed. A public URL needs a
[T3 Connect](remote-access.md) managed tunnel; after you save the task, copy
its URL from the editor. Without one, the editor shows only the URL's path.
**Rotate** replaces the URL and the old one stops working.

The prompt decides what the agent sees. Placeholders pull values out of the
request: `{{body.path}}` for a JSON or form field, `{{headers.name}}`,
`{{query.name}}`, `{{body}}` for the raw body, and `{{request}}` for everything.
For example, `Review this PR: {{body.pull_request.html_url}}` sends only the
pull request link. A placeholder with no value is left empty.

Each value reaches the agent wrapped in `<webhook-data-…>` tags and marked as
untrusted request data. This helps the agent tell it apart from your
instructions, but it doesn't guarantee the agent ignores what the text says.
Inside a value, every `$`, other currency sign and `@`, and a `/` that starts
a lone word, gets an invisible character after it, so mentions like `$skill`,
`@file` and `/command` don't act. Text copied from a value, such as an email
address or a command, carries that character too. Without a signature, anyone
with the URL can start a run with any content. A signature only proves which
service sent the request: a GitHub payload still carries text written by any
GitHub user.

For GitHub, turn on **Require signature**, keep the header
`x-hub-signature-256`, hex encoding and the `sha256=` prefix, and enter the
same secret in the repository's webhook settings with content type
`application/json`. Requests without a valid signature are rejected. Set this
up on desktop or web; mobile keeps an existing signature check but can't turn
one on.

To run only for some requests, add **Filters**. Each one tests a value named
like a placeholder, without the braces, such as `headers.x-github-event` equals
`pull_request` or `body.action` is one of `opened, reopened`. A task runs only
when every filter matches; other requests are answered normally, logged as
**Filtered** with the first filter that failed, and start nothing. Values
compare as text, and a value that is an object or a list only passes
**exists**. Separate **is one of** values with commas; a value can't contain
a comma or start or end with a space.

To suppress repeated deliveries, set a **Duplicate request key** template, such as
`{{headers.delivery-id}}`. The same key is ignored for seven days per task.
To combine a burst, set a **Coalesce key**, such as `{{body.id}}`, and a window
of 10–3600 seconds (120 by default). One run uses the latest body, headers,
and query when the window from the first delivery closes; later requests
do not extend it. Pending windows survive a server restart. Keys must contain
request placeholders; if any placeholder is missing, or the render is empty,
that key's rule is skipped. Clear the templates to turn dedupe off.

Duplicate and coalesced log entries share a limit of 10 per task per minute.
Additional deliveries are accepted without a log entry, and coalesced deliveries
always replace the persisted payload. Coalesced updates count toward a separate
60-per-minute validation limit; exceeding it receives HTTP 429.

On desktop and web, pick **Deliveries** from a task's menu to see recent
requests and the prompt each one produced.

If the environment is offline, the sender gets an error and nothing runs;
redeliver from the sender, such as GitHub's **Recent Deliveries**, once it is
back. To have T3 Connect keep requests instead, turn on **Hold webhooks while
offline** in **Settings → Sharing & access**. T3 Connect then stores requests to a
T3 Connect URL for up to 24 hours and delivers them when the environment
returns. Leave it off if you don't want request bodies stored outside your
machine. To skip requests that waited too long, set **Skip requests older
than** on the task.

## Defaults and inheritance

Threads contains the model and workspace for new threads. Browser controls agent browser
access. Source control contains automatic pull, the default pull request merge method and text
generation. The same rows edit environment defaults or project overrides depending on the
project crumb.

The Projects category, under Code, holds the project's name, icon, actions,
checkouts and removal. Actions belong to a project: editing them creates the project's own list
on each selected environment, and reset returns to the environment's shared list. A project's
`t3.json` actions can be imported there. When a project has several checkouts on one environment,
choose one in the scope line at the top to see or change only that checkout's settings.

Settings a repository can also declare in `t3.json`, such as the workspace for new threads,
resolve in one order: a project override, then the environment setting, then `t3.json`, then the
built-in default. Leave a setting on **Inherit** to let the next tier decide.
Browser access changes apply when an agent session next starts.

New worktrees initialize git submodules recursively. If that step is slow because the repository
declares many nested submodules, set **Submodules** in **Settings → Worktrees** under Advanced (with the project
selected to override it there) to **Top level only** to stop at the ones the repository declares
itself, or **Skip** to leave them for a setup script. It resolves in the same order as the
workspace default: a `"worktreeSubmodules"` value in the `t3.json` of the branch being checked out
applies when the project and environment are both on **Inherit**.

## Worktree location

New worktrees go in the `worktrees` folder of the T3 home directory. To put them somewhere else,
such as another drive, set **Settings → Worktrees → Worktree location** to an absolute path like
`D:\worktrees` or `~/worktrees`. The setting is per machine. Existing worktrees stay where they
are, and cleanup covers both the default folder and the custom one.

## Fast worktree checkout on macOS

Fast worktree checkout is a beta. Turn it on for each Mac in **Settings → Labs → Fast worktree
checkout**. T3 Code then keeps a few recent checkouts of each repository in the `caches` folder of
the T3 home directory. A new worktree is cloned from one of them with APFS copy-on-write, which is
about twice as fast as writing every file and makes the first `git status` in it fast as well.
Turning it off deletes the cache.

The first worktree of a repository uses Git's normal checkout and fills the cache. It needs Git 2.42
or newer. Git's normal checkout is also used for worktrees on a different drive from the T3 home
directory, sparse checkouts, repositories whose attributes use filters such as Git LFS, and
repositories whose checkout settings changed.

## Storage cleanup

Open **Settings → Worktrees → Cleanup** to enable automatic cleanup on one machine or all connected
environments. Policies are off by default and run on the server at startup, when changed, and
hourly. Offline machines keep their existing policies.

Select a project to set **Automatic worktree cleanup** to **Inherit**, **Off**, or **Custom**.
Inherit follows each machine's rules; Off keeps that project's worktrees until you remove them
manually. Custom applies separate worktree rules to the selected project or checkout. Browser
captures and log retention remain machine-wide.

Worktrees can be removed after a chosen number of inactive days, after a thread settles, after
merging, or when they have no commits beyond the default branch and their thread is settled or
archived. Set settled retention to 0 days to remove a worktree at the next cleanup after
settlement. In repositories without remotes,
unchanged-worktree cleanup compares against the branch checked out in the project workspace;
if that checkout has a detached HEAD, the worktree is kept. Only T3-managed worktrees are eligible.
Active sessions and shared worktrees prevent removal. **Keep worktrees with local changes** defaults
to **Uncommitted changes**, which protects tracked edits and untracked files but deletes ignored
files such as `.env` and build output. **Any local files** also protects ignored files other than
`node_modules`. **Edited tracked files** protects only tracked edits and allows untracked and
ignored files to be deleted. Branches and thread history stay; starting another turn recreates the checkout.
Merge cleanup requires a merged pull request whose commits are included in the remote default
branch. A squash or rebase merge on GitHub also counts when the pull request targeted the default
branch and the worktree is still at the pull request's last commit.

Enable **Delete worktrees with deleted threads** to remove safe worktrees after their last
thread is deleted, including archived threads and worktrees left by earlier deletions. The
server waits for sessions and terminals to stop and retries skipped worktrees after restart.
Existing prompts for deleting a worktree manually remain available when this policy is off.

Choose **Delete now** to run the enabled rules immediately. The latest results show which
worktrees were removed or kept and why, plus any failures.
Results also list folders in the worktree folder that no thread uses, with their sizes; cleanup never removes them, so remove them manually if you want.

Browser captures and rotated logs have separate retention periods. Expired capture links stop
working. Current logs, message attachments, and browser profiles are kept.

## Project icons

Select the project and open Project to choose an icon, emoji, monogram, or image. The choice applies to
every checkout in the project group and appears on connected clients. Choose **Automatic** to let
T3 Code detect an icon again.

Choose **Monogram** in the icon picker to set one or two letters or numbers and a color.

When no image is found, web and desktop show a two-character monogram with a color
from the icon palette, derived from the saved project name. For example, `Nebula` becomes `NA`,
`Silver Orchard` becomes `SO`, and `M7 Forge` becomes `M7`.

## Keep the default branch current

In Source control, enable **Automatically pull** to keep the default-branch checkout up to date
with its configured upstream. Choose an environment to set the default or a project to override it.
On mobile, use **Settings → Source control** to change selected environment defaults or project overrides.

T3 Code only pulls when it can fast-forward and the checkout has no changed files, untracked files,
or local commits. It skips checkouts on another branch or without an upstream. If a checkout has
local work, resolve it yourself before automatic pulls can resume.
